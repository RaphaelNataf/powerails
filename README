 ## INTRO & USAGE ##
---------------------

Powerails.sh is a very lightweight shell script (for Mac OS) that allows you to save time during your Ruby on Rails sessions. This is basicly a GUI that gathered all the commands I'm able to use for now.
This can help many "very beginners" in Rails and code noobs like me to save time with explications.
Moreover, even If i don't see how it could be possible, ny other use of this script is not the responsibility of the developer (see below : R.N).

---------------
 ## INSTALL ##
---------------

Just open your Terminal and write the path of the powerails.sh route. (ex : 'root/shell/powerails.sh'). This will start the GUI. All you have to do is to enjoy :)
